*Global Logistics Performance Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to monitor and compare global container shipment volumes against business targets — empowering logistics teams to make data-driven operational decisions.

*Purpose

The Global Logistics Performance Dashboard delivers end-to-end visibility into global container performance.
It enables stakeholders to:
1)Track actual vs target shipments across multiple regions.
2)Measure achievement percentage and variance over time.
3)Identify underperforming routes and channels for strategic action.
4)Built for logistics managers, supply chain analysts, and decision-makers who require real-time performance insights.

*Tech Stack

1)Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization and reporting tool

2)Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning

3)DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Custom calculations for KPIs and variances

4)Data Modeling – Relationships among Fact (Containers) and Dimension (Region, Trade, Channel) tables

5)File Format: .pbix (development) and .png (preview export)
6)Data Source

Source: Internal logistics dataset
Structure:
1)Fact Table: Monthly container actuals and targets
2)Dimensions: Region, Trade Route, Channel

Regions covered:

1)Asia Pacific
2)Europe
3)North America

*Business Problem

Global logistics operations generate large volumes of shipment data, but performance tracking often remains fragmented.
Teams lack a single view to compare actual container shipments vs targets across different regions, channels, and months.

*Goal of the Dashboard

1)To provide a unified, interactive performance tracker that:
2)Measures container volume achievement by region, month, and channel
3)Highlights performance gaps and variance from targets
4)Enables quick filtering and drill-down for deeper insights
5)Supports strategic logistics planning and resource optimization
